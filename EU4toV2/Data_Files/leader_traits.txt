# General/Admiral conversion rules
# 
# All four values (fire, shock, manuever, siege) are read from the EU4 file.
# The rules here set MINIMUM CONDITIONS for each (enabled) personality and background.
# The special value "other" consists of the sum of all unnamed values
# so if a personality specifies "fire" and "other", "other" means "shock + manuever + siege".
# Keep in mind: fire, shock, manuever are capped at 6; siege at 2.
# 
# The first rule that matches is selected, so the better/more restrictive rules should be near the top of each section.
# If some traits are not desired for conversion, simply omit them from the file.
# Default rules are chosen to generally result in POSITIVE traits
