# Overall structure :
#
# default = {
#	map = {
#		...
#	}
#	division_templates = {
#		...
#	}
# }
#
# Vic2 Mod-specific mappings can be defined by copying the "default = { map = { ... } division_templates = { ... } }"  section
# and pasting it by replacing "default" with the appropriate mod name
#
# For example :
# PDM = {
#	map = {
#		...
#	}
#	division_templates = {
#		...
#	}
# }
#
# The "map" section format is used to establish which HoI4 types the Vic2 types are transformed into. It has the following structure :
#
# map = {
# 	link = {
#		vic = <Vic2 type category>
#
#		hoi = {
#			category = <land/air/naval/convoy>
#			type = <HoI4 type category> (Valid Battalion/Support Company, Aircraft category or Naval Vessel category)
#			equipment = <equipment_category>
#			size = <integer number>
#		}
# 	}
#	...
#	link = {
#		...
#	}
# }
#
#
# EXAMPLE :
#
# map = {
# 	# Map every Vic2 Infantry Brigade to 3 x HoI4 Infantry Battalion with the most basic equipment
# 	link = {
# 		vic = infantry
#
# 		hoi = {
# 			category = land
# 			type = infantry
# 			equipment = infantry_equipment_0
# 			size = 3
# 		}
# 	}
# 	# Map every Vic2 Plane types to 10 x Interwar Fighter
# 	link = {
# 		vic = plane
#
# 		hoi = {
# 			category = air
# 			type = fighter
# 			equipment = fighter_equipment_0
# 			size = 10
# 		}
#
#
# 	}
# 	# Map every Vic2 Commerce Raider to a HoI4 Destroyer of the most basic model
# 	link = {
# 		vic = commerce_raider
#
# 		hoi = {
# 			category = naval
# 			type = destroyer
# 			equipment = destroyer_1
# 			size = 1
# 		}
# 	}
# }
#
# Specifying no "hoi" section means that those Vic2 types will not be mapped.
#
# In addition to the above, Division Templates must be defined so that mapped Vic2 ground types are grouped in viable formations.
# The Division Templates have the same structure as found in HoI4.
# The order in which the templates are defined matters. The converter will first try to convert as many divisions of the current category
# and when there are no longer sufficient mapped types available it moves to the next template.
#
#
# EXAMPLE :
#
# division_templates = {
#
# 	# This is a Regular-Priority Infantry Division with 2 x Infantry Regiments, 3 x Battalions Each + 1 x Artillery Regiment with 3 x Battalions and an Engineer Company
#	division_template = {
